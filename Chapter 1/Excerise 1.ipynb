      "\n",
      "   The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. \n",
      "   The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, \n",
      "   in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. \n",
      "\n",
      "   There are two datasets: \n",
      "      1) bank-full.csv with all examples, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010).\n",
      "      2) bank.csv with 10% of the examples (4521), randomly selected from bank-full.csv.\n",
      "   The smallest dataset is provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g. SVM).\n",
      "\n",
      "   The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).\n",
      "\n",

    "One column we may want to refactor is the 'pdays' column. Currently, if the customer was not contacted the value is '-1', whereas if they were contacted the number of days are listed. There are two pieces of information endoded in this one columns that we may want to separate. They are:\n",

Given our column we could test this hyposis by converting the 'pdays' column into a binary variable indicating whether they were contacted or not. This can be achieved by looking to see if the value of 'pdays' is '-1', if so we will associate that with a value of 0, otherwise they have been contacted so the value will be 1.\n",
    "A second hypothesis is that the more recently the customer was contacted the greater likelihood will be for them to subscribe. There are many ways to encode this second hypothesis. I recommend encoding the first one, and if we see that this feature has predictive power we can enode the second hypothesis.\n",
